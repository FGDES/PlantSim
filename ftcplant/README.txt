FAUDES Bottling Plant Simulation

============================================================


The simulation FtcPlant addresses a benchmark example, originally
proposed by Jan Richter, Siemens AG, 2012, in the context of
a joint research project on fault-tolerant control. The
simulation is provided for free and may be useful to study
various aspects in the design of supervisory controllers.
A detailed discussion including a nominal controller design
is available as a separate report (PDF-file included).
