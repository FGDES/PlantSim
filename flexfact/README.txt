FlexFact -- a configurable factory simulator.

For instructions/documentation see
  http://www.rt.eei.uni-erlangen.de/FGdes/flexfact.html

The provided examples require a libFAUDES installation
to run the supervisors via simfaudes. Some examples are
set up as DESTool project, and, hence require a DESTool
installation. However, FlexFact itself does not depend
on libFAUDES/DESTool. Plants can be controlled via
the Modbus/TCP interface, supported by many (Soft-)PLCs.

Contributions are highly wellcome.
